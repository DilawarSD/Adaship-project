# ADASHIP project C++

## Challenge Outline 
This is my project which is called ADASHIP which is based off the game called battleship in C++. The battleship game has several key components that I had face before implementing the functionality. Which are the game board making sure that the board is displayed. Placing the ships onto board either if it is manually or auto-placement. These ships would be different names and sizes such carrier is size 5 and battelship is size 4 in my game. Another thing would be the players themselves as they would need to be interacting with game. Player having their own ships with their own placement on their own board when they go up against the computer. Turn system which is means player or computer take turns when the game starts. The attack option if the computer or player attacks the otehr oppenement they would get know depending on which cell they have attacked it would either be hit or miss depending where they attacked and it is empty it would be a miss and if it has a ship then it would be a hit. Another one was validation so if the board is 10x10 then you say a12 to attack it would be out of bounds and if you already attacked a spot previously and you hit it again it would say that it has already been hit. Winning criteria is that whoever gets rid of all the ships on the opponents board wins. 

My initial working plan at the beginning was to make sure I was able to config my plain text file called adaship_config.ini so it is able to read what I wanted the board size and boats size to be and from there was to create a board that would be able to link with my config so when I want to change the size of the board or boat it will change without me hardcoding it into my board and is just a small update to my plain text file that would change the board and boat size. The strategy that I went with to link these files together was by creating separate files and headers that I would put into the cpp files that would connect the two files and I would run the file through the main.cpp and this was the process that I carried on when I added more files. It helped split the code up and was much easier to maintain and easier to read the code. So after I linked the the board and config file. I then moved on to then implement placing of the ships on the board. This was by again creating a header file and link this to the board and config files as my ship needs access to my boat name and size and the board as I would like the player to be able to place the ships on the board that I created. Also having an option for the player to either manually or automatically. Then the next phase was then adding the player and computer file to be able to access my manual placement ship and automatic ship. Another for player is to be able to manual fire or auto fire on the board to attack the ships on the opponents board and this would be the same as computer. Then the last two was game and menu files. The game file is able to play the game which allows the player and computer to go up against each and having a validation to check winner which is whoever destroys all the ships win. The menu is just to able to have 2 options which are player vs computer and exit which exits you out of the game completely. 

For the board generation it was important to make sure that I got the coloumn and rows to be aligned and so when the user(player) wants to place the ships or attack the ships and the player types the coloumn and row it would go to the right cell that was called. For configuration I wanted to make sure that it is able to able read the board and boats for an example on the plain text it configures from if the board is 10x10 the board without any hardcoding for the 10x10 it would display the board as 10x10 and if I did change the size to 20x20 on the plain text file (adaship_config.ini) the board will automatically change to that size same as the boat size aswell. For the ship placement it was important to make sure that the manual placement was able to go to the right row and coloumn the player would want to put them and with the auto placement is to be place them randomly on the board and also allowing the player to see the ships before carrying on the game if they are ok with the ship placement. For the player is important to be able to place the ships, its also attacking the opponents board with again with accurate placing on where the player wants to attack for an example if the player wants to attack A1 it should attack there, this will be the same for computer with creating their own board and attacking the other board. For the game is making sure to validate the winner which is whoever destroys all of the ships win for an example if player destroys all of computer ships, player is the winner. 

For object-oriented idea was to create classes for each component such as class player which will be available for across all the files so files like game and ship are able to access it. Another design idea that I implemented was a stuct for boats which will be the boats name and sizes that can be reused in the other files for an example ships so the user knows what ship was placed and the size of the ship that was placed on the board for an example carrier is size 5. I used classes which is encapsulation state are stored privately within the specified class for an example I created is player. Another object-oriented idea I was with the classes that I used was inheritance so as I mentioned before class player being able to reuse that across the file without repeating the full code again where I would need to use it for an example I was using class player in the game.cpp file. Abstraction was used such as for boats I create a struct where it has the boat size and boat name within the stuct that can be used for an example boats name and boats size in the ship file in a similar way to inheritance.
